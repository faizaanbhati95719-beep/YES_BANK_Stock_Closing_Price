Project: YES Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction
Domain: Financial Technology (FinTech)

Project Type: Supervised Machine Learning (Regression)

Overview
YES Bank has been a focal point of the Indian financial sector, especially after the 2018 liquidity crisis. This project investigates the stock price journey of YES Bank from its inception to 2020. Using monthly stock data, I’ve developed a robust predictive model that forecasts closing prices while navigating the extreme volatility and "regime changes" caused by corporate events.

Key Highlights
Production-Grade Code: Implemented with modular functions and strict exception handling.

Strategic EDA: Conducted 10+ logical visualizations following the UBM (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate) rule.

Data Science Best Practices: Utilized Log-Transformation to handle positive skewness and addressed multicollinearity for model stability.
